Riffle
- Choose pivot element
- Divide deck into two partitions at the pivot
- Merge deck by interleaving the partitions
- A cut is choosing another pivot, then swapping the order of the two partitions defined by this pivot.
- To achieve a uniform distribution this process needs to be repeated some number of iterations.
    For a standard 52 card deck 7 Iterations are necessary to achieve a sample from the uniform distribution.
